# Design

> Session-based MMO. Weak → Overpowered in one session. Permanent unlocks are horizontal (new powers/variations), not vertical (stats).

## Immediate Priority: Game Feel

**Movement must feel powerful.** Reference: PROTOTYPE series. Every step has weight and momentum. Traversal itself is satisfying before combat even starts.

**Combat must feel impactful.** Hit-stop, screen shake, enemy reactions. Attacks have consequence.

| System    | Target Feel                                                                                 |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Movement  | Weighty, propulsive, powerful. PROTOTYPE-style momentum and impact per step                 |
| Combat    | Crunchy. Hit-stop + screen shake + enemy stagger. High enemy count, low HP (VS/PoE density) |
| Targeting | Cone-based auto-target (no click targeting)                                                 |
| Damage    | AoE default on basic attacks                                                                |

## Progression

| Aspect | Design |
|--------|--------|
| Session | Power resets. Basic → Overpowered within one session |
| Permanent | Horizontal unlocks only: new powers, variations, options. Not stat increases |
| Weapon | Geometry/utility shifts during run based on performance |

## World (Later)

| Aspect | Design |
|--------|--------|
| Topology | Shared open world (non-instanced) |
| Sessions | Temporary maps as session timer |
| Social | Organic convergence, no matchmaking |

## Player Interest (Later)

| Lever | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| Pacing | Alternate intensity: combat → exploration → puzzle |
| Novelty | Steady mechanic introduction; foreshadow via inaccessible areas |
| Flow | Dynamic difficulty; short runs + procedural variation |

## Combat Design Pillars (CircleToonsHD Framework)

Five ingredients of satisfying combat, and how they map to this project:

| Ingredient | Principle | Our Application |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Agency** | Players handle situations their way; combat is avoidable; playthroughs feel unique | Horizontal unlocks → varied builds per session. Stealth/avoidance as viable choices (later) |
| **Control** | Depth over button-mashing; every input has purpose; combos unlock over time | Cone-based auto-target + deliberate AoE attacks. Skill expression through positioning and timing, not click accuracy |
| **Imbalance** | Tug-of-war difficulty; weaponize player comfort by evolving challenges; power scaling is felt | Session reset → replay the weak-to-overpowered arc. Early enemies become fodder, proving progression |
| **Evolution** | Meaningful upgrades that change how you play, not minor stat boosts | Horizontal permanent unlocks (new powers/variations). Weapon geometry shifts mid-run |
| **Clarity** | Intuitive feedback over tutorials; players understand state through design, not text | Hit-stop, screen shake, color-coded damage, enemy reactions. The juice *is* the communication |

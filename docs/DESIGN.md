# Design

> Session-based MMO. Weak → Overpowered in one session. Permanent unlocks are horizontal (new powers/variations), not vertical (stats).

## Immediate Priority: Game Feel

**Movement must feel powerful.** Reference: PROTOTYPE series. Every step has weight and momentum. Traversal itself is satisfying before combat even starts.

**Combat must feel impactful.** Hit-stop, screen shake, enemy reactions. Attacks have consequence.

| System | Target Feel |
|--------|-------------|
| Movement | Weighty, propulsive, powerful. PROTOTYPE-style momentum and impact per step |
| Combat | Crunchy. Hit-stop + screen shake + enemy stagger. High enemy count, low HP (VS/PoE density) |
| Targeting | Cone-based auto-target (no click targeting) |
| Damage | AoE default on basic attacks |

## Progression

| Aspect | Design |
|--------|--------|
| Session | Power resets. Basic → Overpowered within one session |
| Permanent | Horizontal unlocks only: new powers, variations, options. Not stat increases |
| Weapon | Geometry/utility shifts during run based on performance |

## World (Later)

| Aspect | Design |
|--------|--------|
| Topology | Shared open world (non-instanced) |
| Sessions | Temporary maps as session timer |
| Social | Organic convergence, no matchmaking |

## Player Interest (Later)

| Lever | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| Pacing | Alternate intensity: combat → exploration → puzzle |
| Novelty | Steady mechanic introduction; foreshadow via inaccessible areas |
| Flow | Dynamic difficulty; short runs + procedural variation |

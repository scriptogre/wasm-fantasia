# Game Design Concepts

## Core Vision
*   **Genre:** Session-Based MMO.
*   **Goal:** Combine MMO social persistence with Roguelike power progression.
*   **Philosophy:** "Sovereign" Engagement. Reject standard retention tactics (FOMO, daily checklists) in favor of intrinsic motivation and respect for player time.
*   **Constraints:** Low time commitment (short sessions), high engagement (fast power curve).

## Engagement Principles
*   **Autonomy:** Game does not dictate when to play. Absence results in accumulated opportunity (e.g., rested bonuses, stacked keys), not punishment or missed exclusive rewards.
*   **Competence:** Visual progression is tied to gameplay achievement. No cosmetic cash shop; a player's appearance is an authentic verified record of their feats (you only wear the dragon hide if you killed the dragon).
*   **Relatedness:** Reject automated matchmaking (LFG tools) in favor of natural world convergence. Social interaction should emerge from necessity and shared objectives, not UI convenience.
*   **Significance:** The economy and world state rely on player input. Even if power resets, the *impact* on the market or hub world must be persistent and non-simulated.

## Progression Logic
*   **Session Loop:** Player power resets after every session.
*   **Power Curve:** Rapid growth from "Basic" to "Overpowered" within a single session.
*   **Persistence:** Retain currency/materials for permanent unlocking in a hub area.
*   **Weapon Evolution (Concept):** The weapon changes geometry/utility during the run based on performance, rather than just stat increases.

## Combat Considerations (In Progress)
*   **Input Scheme:** WASD movement.
*   **Targeting Logic:** Cone-based auto-targeting (no manual clicking required).
*   **Damage Logic:** Area-of-Effect (AoE) by default on basic attacks to prevent single-target tedium.
*   **Game Feel:**
    *   **Impact:** Using hit-stop (frame freezing) to add weight to attacks.
    *   **Mobbing:** High enemy count, low individual enemy health. Vampire Survivors / Path of Exile style dopamine hits.

## World Structure Ideas (In Progress)
*   **Topology:** Shared open world (non-instanced) to maintain the MMO vibe.
*   **Map System:** Temporary maps that appear and disappear, acting as the "Session" timer.
*   **Social:** Players naturally converge on these temporary maps, creating organic "frontlines" without forced parties.
